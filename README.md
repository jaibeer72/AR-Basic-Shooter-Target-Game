Augmented Reality.
-------------------------------

### What It is? 

"An augmented reality app (AR app) is a software application that
integrates digital visual content (and sometimes audio and other types)
into the user's real-world environment. AR software is used for
training, work and consumer applications in many industries including
healthcare, public safety, gas and oil, tourism and
marketing."[^1][

[

[Basically, the idea of adding a layer of an interactable environment to
the existing environment can be a way to describe augmented
reality.

### [Pre Requisites

[Things that you require before you can build anything with these apps
are simple

[Knowing

-   [The platform you will be building for. This can be IOS, Android or
    > even other OS's but they need to have a supported
    > framework.

-   [Engine: Software that can convert, power and render different types
    > of data into content.

-   [A framework that can be pre-defined code that can help you
    > implement the process with a predefined pipeline. For example,
    > Viforia which I will get into in a bit

-   [Or an SDK.

### [Vuforia 

[This is one of the most used AR frameworks in the industry. The Vuforia
engine boasts a lot of features to help in the process which includes
the following[^2][

[  ![](.//media/image10.png){width="5.723958880139983in"
height="3.841327646544182in"}[

[Let\'s look at some case studies.

#### [Case Studies of Vuforia. 

![](.//media/image34.png){width="6.270833333333333in"
height="3.4027777777777777in"}[^3] [This was a game which used Vuforia
to give the LEGO world a more interactive twist. The idea was simple The
LEGO toy company had these toys that they wanted to add a more level of
interaction to and help their customers have a more fun experience with
them so they introduced a game that used AR to allow them to have a
richer experience with the toys.

### [Prospect and Scale

[As the industry matures the idea of it to be restricted to games is
very naive. The implications of this may be limited based on technology
as the technology has to go through its hurdles with its Technological
limitations such as graphics requirements for math computations and
sometimes it might be a little difficult for the user to understand what
is going on.

[

[When it comes to businesses there are huge implications as it helps
business to showcase their products before they have fully realised them
and can just use 3D models to showcase the strength of the product they
are trying to introduce.

[Virtual Reality
----------------------------

### [What It is?

["Virtual reality (VR) means experiencing things through our computers
that don\'t really exist. From that simple definition, the idea doesn\'t
sound especially new. When you look at an amazing Canaletto painting,
for example, you\'re experiencing the sites and sounds of Italy as it
was about 250 years ago---so that\'s a kind of virtual reality. In the
same way, if you listen to ambient instrumental or classical music with
your eyes closed, and start dreaming about things, isn\'t that an
example of virtual reality---an experience of a world that doesn\'t
really exist? What about losing yourself in a book or a movie? Surely
that\'s a kind of virtual reality?" [^4][

[

[The idea of experiencing a different world through the lens of a
computer where everything is possible has always been an exciting
prospect for people. VR as an industry has been ever expanding and its
availability also increasing through the gaming world with oculus rift,
PSVR so on has always been the new generation of trying things. Things
such as the open project like google cardboard have further helped its
growth but mainly now being used in the world of Real estate to help
people buy better has also been a great opportunity.

*["Types of virtual reality*

*[\"Virtual reality\" has often been used as a marketing buzzword for
compelling, interactive video games or even 3D movies and television
programs, none of which really count as VR because they don\'t immerse
you either fully or partially in a virtual world. Search for \"virtual
reality\" in your cellphone app store and you\'ll find hundreds of hits,
even though a tiny cellphone screen could never get anywhere near
producing the convincing experience of VR. Nevertheless, things like
interactive games and computer simulations would certainly meet parts of
our definition up above, so there\'s clearly more than one approach to
building virtual worlds---and more than one flavor of virtual reality.
Here are a few of the bigger variations:*

*[Fully immersive*

*[For the complete VR experience, we need three things. First, a
plausible, and richly detailed virtual world to explore; a computer
model or simulation, in other words. Second, a powerful computer that
can detect what we\'re going and adjust our experience accordingly, in
real time (so what we see or hear changes as fast as we move---just like
in real reality). Third, hardware linked to the computer that fully
immerses us in the virtual world as we roam around. Usually, we\'d need
to put on what\'s called a head-mounted display (HMD) with two screens
and stereo sound, and wear one or more sensory gloves. Alternatively, we
could move around inside a room, fitted out with surround-sound
loudspeakers, onto which changing images are projected from outside.
We\'ll explore VR equipment in more detail in a moment.*

*[Non-immersive*

*[A highly realistic flight simulator on a home PC might qualify as
nonimmersive virtual reality, especially if it uses a very wide screen,
with headphones or surround sound, and a realistic joystick and other
controls. Not everyone wants or needs to be fully immersed in an
alternative reality. An architect might build a detailed 3D model of a
new building to show to clients that can be explored on a desktop
computer by moving a mouse. Most people would classify that as a kind of
virtual reality, even if it doesn\'t fully immerse you. In the same way,
computer archaeologists often create engaging 3D reconstructions of
long-lost settlements that you can move around and explore. They don\'t
take you back hundreds or thousands of years or create the sounds,
smells, and tastes of prehistory, but they give a much richer experience
than a few pastel drawings or even an animated movie.*

*[Collaborative*

*[What about \"virtual world\" games like Second Life and Minecraft? Do
they count as virtual reality? Although they meet the first four of our
criteria (believable, interactive, computer-created and explorable),
they don\'t really meet the fifth: they don\'t fully immerse you. But
one thing they do offer that cutting-edge VR typically doesn\'t is
collaboration: the idea of sharing an experience in a virtual world with
other people, often in real time or something very close to it.
Collaboration and sharing are likely to become increasingly important
features of VR in future.*

*[Web-based*

[*Virtual reality was one of the hottest, fastest-growing technologies
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but the rapid rise of the World Wide
Web largely killed off interest after that. Even though computer
scientists developed a way of building virtual worlds on the Web (using
a technology analogous to HTML called Virtual Reality Markup Language,
VRML), ordinary people were much more interested in the way the Web gave
them new ways to access real reality---new ways to find and publish
information, shop, and share thoughts, ideas, and experiences with
friends through social media. With Facebook\'s growing interest in
technology, the future of VR seems likely to be both Web-based and
collaborative.*"

[

[AR is actually a sub-product of VR where through a screen you are
trying to place an object in the world while in VR you are trying to
place yourself in the screen.

[

### [Pre Requisites

[At the end of the day, VR is a very demanding process as it requires
sometimes really strong hardware. Hence initially it was only used for
simulations for teaching and growing industries. Now due to more
optimization and increasing use of better technology, we can even use it
on our mobile devices the games that can be made can be fun and
interactive.

### [Prospect and Scale

[

[Hack and Slash linear game. 
-----------------------------------------

### [What It is? 

[It's a Genre of games in which you basically hack and slash your way
through AI and win. The idea of these games have always existed so we
will look into my most favourite ones during my research

### [Pre Requisites

[The pre-requisite in this one is simple I need an engine like unity and
make it work. It is now the technology is not that hard and can be well
done and polished.

[

[Ideation
=====================

[Town Of Salem 3D 
------------------------------

### [About Town Of Salem 

["Town of Salem is a browser-based game that challenges players on their
ability to convincingly lie as well as detect when other players are
lying. The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly
divided into alignments -- Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and
Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down
the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't
know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role,
such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of
night and try to avoid getting caught."[^5][

[

[So basically a card game with an attitude of deception.

### [Why in 3D? 

[Basically I believe that sometimes a card game can be easily be
transformed to be more intersting. The idea is to get the people playing
to convince others that you are not the serial killer when the last
thing you may have done is sneak into someone\'s house and tried to
murder them

[First Draw AR. 
----------------------------

### [What is a First Draw? 

[**"Fast draw**, also known as **quick draw**, is the ability to quickly
draw a pistol and fire it accurately on a target. This skill was made
popular by romanticized depictions of gunslingers in the Western genre,
which in turn were inspired by famous historical gunfights in the
American Old West."[^6][

[

[So this is something a lot of people played as a kid and growing up.
Sometimes using finger guns which never allowed a clear winner as it was
all based on a general agreement between 2 player.

[

[The game was as in the old west people would have their gun in
holstered and then walk 10 steps away from each other. Then look at each
other and based on who took their gun out first and was able to shoot
the other person would win causing the other person\'s
death.

### [How will it work in AR?

[This will require me to use the 3 sensors of the phone the sensor "The
gyroscope" the distance calculator and the camera.

[

1.  [The phone will use the gyroscope and the sensor to detect when the
    > phone is in the pocket.

2.  [There will probably be an AR target on the player\'s shirt or
    > something similar.

3.  [When the game starts the one who shot first will win. Based on the
    > camera and tap.

4.  [This will also require a multiplayer connection using Bluetooth and
    > or a network.

[Magic Mindset
--------------------------

### [Basic Idea and rules a VR game that can be basically a magic throwing to destroy enemies 

[

[Finalised Game: AR 
================================

[Why deciding AR? 
------------------------------

[Basically, I wanted to work with new technology. So AR seemed like a
good idea as it can work with most phones and can be something new to
work with. So i decided it was a good thing to get started
with.

[

[

[Beginning. 
========================

[So initially I wanted to try the simple AR projects to see how it
works. So we need to first make an AR camera and have it run . So the
first things to do to

![](.//media/image26.png){width="6.270833333333333in"
height="3.5277777777777777in"}[

[

[First we required to register as a developer and then we could simple
open a project in unity as a 3d project

[And load the Vuforia packages

[

![](.//media/image20.png){width="6.270833333333333in"
height="3.5277777777777777in"}[

[Add a AR camera and also add the licence to the game.

[Then we load up a simple Fish animation from an example package and
also remove the TVOS from the player settings

[

[And Vola! we are ready.

[ 

[We put the AR camera settings to track the rotation rather than
position so basically now then we export

![](.//media/image24.png){width="1.7708333333333333in"
height="3.53125in"}![](.//media/image15.png){width="1.8333333333333333in"
height="3.53125in"}![](.//media/image22.png){width="1.78125in"
height="3.53125in"}[

[We can now look around at fishes on our AR camera.

[This is a pretty good start but now we need to be able to track things
in AR to be efficient so we need to try a little bit of image
tracking.

[Image Tracking
===========================

[Setup :- 
----------------------

[This was slightly tricky. Cause i needed to first know the exact
dimensions of something and have it around. Luckily i had a book lying
around that could be a good. First i needed to register it as a database
on the developer website

[

![](.//media/image31.png){width="6.270833333333333in"
height="3.5277777777777777in"}![](.//media/image33.png){width="6.270833333333333in"
height="3.5277777777777777in"}[

[

[Basically it will create a data set file that can be used by unity as a
target and the image has to be defined in meters.

[

![](.//media/image25.png){width="6.270833333333333in"
height="3.5277777777777777in"}[

[

[Basically in the hierarchy we define an image target and on that target
we can place whatever and it can be used to add anything on top of it.
This was something that made it easy powerful but for billboard
perspoises powerful.

[

[We needed to find a way to have some targets on randomly and i was
still not sure how to track them.

[

[So we got introduced to user defined targets in one of the example
assets from the vuforia asset store.

[

[User Defined Target
================================

[Now we can use basically user defined targets that can hopefully put in
multiple targets and game objects in this can be understood by using the
example assets from the asset store.

[

[  ![](.//media/image36.png){width="6.270833333333333in"
height="3.5277777777777777in"}[

[

[The core samples lets us mess around with a lot of thing but taking
that some limitations came about because of support of phones. Some
features won\'t work.

[

[Understanding the code: 
-------------------------------------

[The way Vuforia uses user defined targets is the same as predefined
image targets. The only difference is one is happening during runtime
and is highly inaccurate compared to the other which was really evident
while testing it out.

[

[But they way it has to work is simple. Yo basically create a user
defined target builder that can be built on runtime

![](.//media/image18.png){width="6.270833333333333in"
height="3.5277777777777777in"}[

[

[And can be run over time.

[And place the object that you want it to spawn on the user defined
target in the hierarchy and we need to test the quality of the target
(the more edges on the target the better.)

[

[Which can be easily be

[

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [switch (quality)\
  {\
  case (Vuforia.ImageTargetBuilder.FrameQuality.FRAME\_QUALITY\_NONE):\
  SetMeter(Color.gray, Color.gray, Color.gray);\
  break;\
  case (Vuforia.ImageTargetBuilder.FrameQuality.FRAME\_QUALITY\_LOW):\
  SetMeter(Color.red, Color.gray, Color.gray);\
  break;\
  case (Vuforia.ImageTargetBuilder.FrameQuality.FRAME\_QUALITY\_MEDIUM):\
  SetMeter(Color.red, Color.yellow, Color.gray);\
  break;\
  case (Vuforia.ImageTargetBuilder.FrameQuality.FRAME\_QUALITY\_HIGH):\
  SetMeter(Color.red, Color.yellow, Color.green);\
  break;\
  }

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

[

[After the quality is good enough it can actually try and build a
target.

[Which then is sent to build the target here

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [public void BuildNewTarget()\
  {\
  if (m\_FrameQuality == ImageTargetBuilder.FrameQuality.FRAME\_QUALITY\_MEDIUM \|\|\
  m\_FrameQuality == ImageTargetBuilder.FrameQuality.FRAME\_QUALITY\_HIGH)\
  {\
  // create the name of the next target.\
  // the TrackableName of the original, linked ImageTargetBehaviour is extended with a continuous number to ensure unique names\
  string targetName = string.Format(\"{0}-{1}\", ImageTargetTemplate.TrackableName, m\_TargetCounter);\
  \
  // generate a new target:\
  m\_TargetBuildingBehaviour.BuildNewTarget(targetName, ImageTargetTemplate.GetSize().x);\
  }\
  else\
  {\
  Debug.Log(\"Cannot build new target, due to poor camera image quality\");\
  if (m\_QualityDialog)\
  {\
  StopAllCoroutines();\
  m\_QualityDialog.GetComponent\<CanvasGroup\>().alpha = 1;\
  StartCoroutine(FadeOutQualityDialog());\
  }\
  }\
  }

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[

[The problem is it all happens in the background. You cannot really have
too much of the inner control as well but till it works smoothly it
works as shown down below.

[

![](.//media/image4.png){width="1.78125in"
height="3.53125in"}![](.//media/image19.png){width="1.7916666666666667in"
height="3.53125in"}![](.//media/image5.png){width="1.7604166666666667in"
height="3.53125in"}[

[

[

[

[This still does not help as we need to place targets randomly and it
needs to be able to recognise the ground plain.

[

[Which as i found out due to the lack or resources a lot of android
phones do not support it which is really not fun.

[

[Also the user defined target also need the edges like target system to
calculate the already existing targets and further off non existing can
make it difficult

[

[

[So now i need to work on versions of it.

[

[Monster Eater
==========================

[AR target shooter 
-------------------------------

[Now like earlier we do a simple import of the Vuforia and other assets
and set up the AR camera in the scene. The first version of the game is
supposed to be a simple shoot the target so i imported 3 main
assets.

[

![](.//media/image23.png){width="6.270833333333333in"
